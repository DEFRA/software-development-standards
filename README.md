## About

These standards are part of our efforts to keep our work consistent and of a high quality across the services and projects we build and maintain.

They are based on an agreed [set of principles](/principles/README.md).

It has been produced as a series of markdown files to make the process of adding and maintaining the documentation as simple as possible. Nothing is fixed and anything documented here is open to change.

It is maintained under source control to cater for this, allowing anyone to make suggestions for improvement via the standard [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

It is pushed to GitHub to make it publicly accessible and to render the content in a presentable format.

It is heavily inspired by the work of [ThoughtBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides).

## Contributing to this project

We encourage everyone to contribute to these standards!

We only ask that contributions are made using pull requests, where they can then be discussed and approved by the [DEFRA/sds-group](https://github.com/orgs/DEFRA/teams/sds-group).

Please ensure you have read our [principles](/principles/README.md) first, and then [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.
