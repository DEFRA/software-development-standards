# Software development standards

## About

This is the home for standards and guidance relating to software development in [Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs).

These form part of the software development standards policy for Defra and apply to all software development undertaken on behalf of the Defra group whether by staff, contingent workers or suppliers.

All developers working on behalf of Defra need to be aware of their obligation to follow these standards.

We maintain these standards on GitHub to ensure they have the greatest visiblity to all developers and are readily available in a familiar environment. To aid readability, you can refer to the [GitHub documentation on managing accessibility settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/managing-accessibility-settings).

## Principles

The standards and guidance provided here a based on an agreed set of principles.

## Contributing to this project

We encourage everyone to contribute to these standards!

They have been produced as a series of markdown files to make the process of adding and maintaining the documentation as simple as possible.

It is maintained under source control to cater for this, allowing anyone to make suggestions for improvement via the standard [pull request process](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). They can then be discussed and approved by the [DEFRA/sds-group](https://github.com/orgs/DEFRA/teams/sds-group).

Please ensure you have read our [principles](/principles/README.md) first, and then [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.
