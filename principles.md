# Principles for software development standards

These are general principles that underpin the software development guidance and standards.

## Background

There are a number of factors that can influence the decision to adopt a particular development standard. The purpose of these principles is to condense all of those factors into a simple set of statements that can be used to help with those decisions.

## Principles

### Don't re-invent the wheel

> We adopt standards, guidance and approaches that are already in use in the industry or elsewhere in government

- This accords with the general [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
- It saves us effort

### Do the minimum necessary

> We only develop guidance and standards where there is a rationale for it

- This accords with the general [principle of keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- We don't needlessly constrain work by creating unnecessary standards
- It saves us effort

### Start small

> We create a minimum viable product and then iteratively improve it

- We quickly see if something works
- It is easier to respond when things change
- It prevents us from [trying to predict the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- It helps us do the minimum necessary

### Be open

> We work in the open, providing the maximum amount of access possible

- [More eyes makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better)
- People can buy-in more easily
- It helps us do the minimum necessary

### Minimise work in progress

> We don't try to do too much at once

- It's better to have one thing that can be used than many that can't
