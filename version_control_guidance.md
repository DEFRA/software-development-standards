# Version control guidance

This guidance helps to explain how to apply version control to our code.

It is compliant with our version control standards, but provides some additional information on ways to implement
version control practice.

## Guidance

### Teams

When managing access to version control repositories, it is good practice to create permission groups that
represent wider teams grouped around an entire product or service rather than individual repositories or groups
consisting of 'everyone'.

This prevents individual repositories being used for multiple, distinct components that should each have their own
version management, whilst also ensuring that access to the repositories is appropriately controlled.
