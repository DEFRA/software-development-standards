# Principles for software development standards

This folder contains details on principles related to specific areas, and below general principles that underpin all our guidance and standards.

## Background

There are a number of factors that can influence the decision to adopt a particular development standard. The purpose of these principles is to condense all of those factors into a simple set of statements that can be used to help with those decisions.

## Principles

### Don't re-invent the wheel

> We adopt standards, guidance and approaches that are already in use in the industry or elsewhere in government

- This accords with the general [principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
- It saves us effort

### Do the minimum necessary

> We only develop guidance and standards where there is a rationale for it

- This accords with the general [principle of keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- We don't needlessly constrain work by creating unnecessary standards
- It saves us effort

### Start small

> We create a minimum viable product and then iteratively improve it

- We quickly see if something works
- It is easier to respond when things change
- It prevents us from [trying to predict the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- It helps us do the minimum necessary

### Be open

> We work in the open, providing the maximum amount of access possible

- [More eyes makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better)
- People can buy-in more easily
- It helps us do the minimum necessary

### Minimise work in progress

> We don't try to do too much at once

- It's better to have one thing that can be used than many that can't

### Be reasonable

> We understand that standards represent a snapshot of our best understanding at a point in time and we explicitly articulate this in all of our standards

- This allows us to make sensible, value-based judgements about when it is appropriate to retro-fit standards
- It ensures clarity by mandating that all standards must define the period of time that they are effective and how they have changed over time
- It encourages uptake by allowing people to safely adopt the standards that are effective at the time without being committed to any and all possible future changes to those standards
- It helps people clearly describe and manage their divergence from standards over time and the work required for convergence

### Be helpful

> We include the use of appropriate tools and techniques when we design our standards

- Automation makes it easier for people to adopt the standards
- This makes the standards more likely to be adopted and the benefits more likely to be realised
