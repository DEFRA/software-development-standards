# SQL Prompt

At the moment we are trialing the use of [SQL Prompt](https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-prompt/) to perform code analysis and formatting. This was pretty much the only tool we could find that could format and analyse T-SQL that worked. We tried a few free ones but these were not very good and only did basic formatting, not code analysis. A 28 day trial version can be downloaded from <https://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-prompt/>.

SQL Prompt has the following funtionality

- Advanced IntelliSense-style code completion
- Code snippet library
- Refactor SQL code
- Fast and comprehensive code analysis
- SSMS tab history and coloring
- Advanced customizable and sharable code formatting

Follow these links for SQL Prompt's [Documentation](https://documentation.red-gate.com/sp9) and the [Code Analysis Rules](https://documentation.red-gate.com/codeanalysis) it uses.

We trialed SQL Prompt over 2 weeks and have found it very good at tidying up code and making it consistent. We also found thats it's other features made writing T-SQL quicker & easier. Although we were happy with its settings straight out of the box these can be changed and shared easily.

More trialing by other T-SQL developers would be useful before any decisions are made.
