# Using Unmanaged Devices

A guide for everyone that needs to use unmanaged devices.

### What is this about?
This guide is about the appropriate steps you should take when using devices that are not managed by the normal
organisational IT controls.

Primarily that means developer's laptops.

### Does it apply to you?
Most people are issued with devices have been pre-configured with the organisation's standard IT controls in place.

For some people, however, these standard devices are too restricted and prevent us from performing our duties.

In these cases, you will have been issued with an _unmanaged_ device.

#### How do I know if my device is unmanaged?
You will have been issued with the device by your line manager and informed that it is an unmanaged device.

If you have a device and you do not know whether it is managed or unmanaged then ask your line manager.

#### What if it is my own device?
We do not allow people to use their own devices for official work. Please don't do it.

> This includes personal smartphones chatting on [Slack](https://slack.com), personal tablets used to
> [appear.in](https://appear.in/), etc.  Seriously, please don't.

One day we might have thought through the policy for official data on privately-owned equipment sufficiently to make
this happen, but we're not there yet.

#### How do I know if this guidance applies for my device?
This guidance applies for _all_ unmanaged devices.

### Who can you talk to about this?
If you have any questions, comments or criticisms then please contact me.

### What is different for unmanaged devices?
The main difference is that **you must apply all the necessary security controls to the device yourself**.

If you are not comfortable with the full set of responsibilities outlined in this guide then speak to your line manager.
It may be best to return the unmanaged device and replace it with a managed device.

### What are the security controls you need to apply?
The precise controls that you need to apply will vary depending on the type of device that you have and how you need
to use it.

These controls are outlined in the following sections.

However, there are some common controls that you must apply in all cases and these are described first.

### Common controls
These controls must be applied whatever type of unmanaged device you use.

#### Be aware of your responsibilities
Familiarise yourself with your organisation's information handling responsibilities, acceptable use policies and code
of conduct for the use of IT and digital resources.

We need to be especially mindful of these as the standard IT security controls often help us to comply with them
without us even realising it.

#### Understand the security principles
Read the [CESG End User Devices Security Guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-security), in
particular the [Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-devices-security-principles).

This should give you a good understanding of the kind of controls that are required and why they are necessary.

If you have any questions then speak to your line manager.

#### Ensure your device is registered on the appropriate inventory
Your line manager must have a record of your device and it must be recorded in a shared inventory.  In most cases, the
device itself will also have an asset identifier on it, usually in the form of a sticker.

This ensures that we can keep track of the device and prevent it becoming lost when people move roles.  It also allows
to audit equipment for security compliance.

#### Keep your device patched and up to date
Whatever device you are using, you will not be receiving updates distributed by your organisation so you will need to
apply these yourself.

You should normally apply all patches and updates immediately.  The only exception to this is where you need to
maintain older versions of software to do compatibility testing.

#### Ensure that you are using official online resources
One of the main reasons for having unmanaged devices is to be able to make use of online resources, but this can be a
significant threat leading to the compromise of devices.

For this reason, only officially approved online resources should be accessed.

Any legitimate online resources that you are likely to encounter will be approved for your access.

If you are not sure whether an online resource is officially approved then speak to your line manager.

#### Do not compromise the organisation's corporate network
Under normal circumstances you must never connect your device to the organisation's internal corporate network.

However, for some work it may be appropriate to use the device on the corporate network and when this has been
officially approved then you must ensure that the network is not compromised.

#### Keep the device physically secure



### Controls for Wintel laptops (Linux or Windows)

#### Don't set a BIOS password
BIOS passwords don't add any greater security to the device and primarily only help to prevent accidental
mis-configuration.

Setting such passwords can make it more difficult to reuse the device so do not set a BIOS password.

#### Use the latest stable desktop operating system
Windows 10 Enterprise
Linux Mint 18.2
Ubuntu 16.04

Don't use server versions of operating systems.

If you need to work with a different version then use a virtualisation technology.

#### Don't use dual boot
Pick a preferred operating system and use that.
