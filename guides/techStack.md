Tech stack for APHA .NET legacy systems. 

All of the APHA legacy systems were built in visual studio 2010 or earlier.
When these systems are checked out to be worked on in versions of visual studio from 2015 onwards, VS will rebuild them and this breaks them. Many of the errors caused by this can only be fixed by a massive rewrite of the code. 

Hence the only feasible option to work with these systems is to open them in VS2010.

The majority are written in Visual Basic, with the remainder in C#
