# Guide for new Defra developers

Welcome to Defra! This guide is an overview of tools and resources available to you as a developer, and how to get access to them.

## Developing in government

### Defra development standards

You can find [our software development standards](https://github.com/DEFRA/software-development-standards/) on GitHub (in this very repository!)

### Cross-government standards

The Government Digital Service (GDS) sets standards for government digital services.

You can read these standards here:

- [Service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)
- [Service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)

## Meet the community

### Get onto Slack

Digital teams in Defra use Slack to keep in touch. Slack is a messaging app that lets you talk to colleagues in your team, department, or even across government.

[Join the Defra Digital Slack](https://defra-digital.slack.com/)

If you have a Defra email address, you should be able to sign up to this Slack workspace yourself.

You may also want to join the [UK Government Digital Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/). This has thousands of members from across government, and useful channels about software development and security.

### Come to a developer meetup

Developer community of practice meetups are a chance to meet other developers, share what you’re working on, and find out news and updates about best practice.

Participating in the community of practice is considered part of your core job, so we encourage both permanent and contract devs to come along.

Meetups usually happen in our four hub offices, but developers from any office are welcome to attend.

## Tech and tools

What technology you’ll be using depends on the service you work on. Here are some common resources and tools to be aware of, and how to access them.

### Access to Git, VPN, Jenkins and more

Access to GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins and other infrastructure services is managed by the Web Ops team.

We aim to develop in the open on GitHub. However, some repos (especially things like environment config) are privately stored on GitLab.

You will need VPN access to get to GitLab, Jenkins and our development environments.

Contact the Web Ops team or another developer to request access to these services.

### Access to Jira

Many teams use the project management tool Jira to manage their work.
