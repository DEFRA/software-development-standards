# Security Standard

Having a secure approach to development has never been so important.

The way we build software and systems is rapidly evolving, becoming more and more automated and integrated. This results in a need to have some standards and guidance around security. Rather than maintain our own, we follow the standards of [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)

## Standards

Use the [OWASP Secure coding practices - quick reference guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Coding_Practices_-_Quick_Reference_Guide) for details of the standards to apply.

**Important note.** We are using version 2
