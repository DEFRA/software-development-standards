# README standards

A README file must exist in every repo in markdown format (.md). It must include the following if they apply:

- Description of product
- Prerequisites
- Development tools setup
- Test tools setup
- How to run in development
- How to run tests
- How to make changes to the code

## Additional detail

Depending on the complexity of the product, the following may be included in the README, or it may be more effective to capture in separate documentation/diagrams referenced by the README.

- How product fits into wider architecture
- Internal product architecture
- Data structure
- API end points
- Monitoring
- Error handling
- Audit
- User access
- Security
- Complexity worth documenting
- Pipelines
