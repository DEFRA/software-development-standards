# Standards

This folder contains all current standards for software development.

Our standards are intended to:

- Make the produced code more easily read and understood
- Make the code more easily maintainable
- Make the code more reliable

## Versioning

Our standards are updated on an ongoing basis. Anything using these standards should therefore refer to these standards not only by name, for example **C# coding standards**, but also by date, for example **as at 2020-01-08**.

Whilst we always endeavour to keep code consistent with the latest standards, not all projects are active. This means as standards change some projects will no longer meet them. Having a reference to when the standard was last applied, will help when determining the effort to update a project.
