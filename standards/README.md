# Standards

This folder contains all current standards for software development.

Our standards are intended to:

- Make the produced code more easily read and understood
- Make the code more easily maintainable
- Make the code more reliable

## Versioning

Our standards are updated on an ongoing basis. Anything using these standards should therefore refer to these standards not only be name, for example **C# coding standards**, but also by version, for example **1.0**.

It should not be assumed that established products will be continually retrospectively updated to always reflect the very latest iteration of these standards: therefore recording which specific version of these standards has been adopted (and keeping all the preceding versions of these standards) is essential.
