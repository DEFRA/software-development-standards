#  DEFRA Software Engineering GitHub Readme.md Template (Replace this text with your Product Title)
\<How to use this template: 
all text within \<....\> is only here for your guidance and should be deleted and replaced with your own text. Include
a very brief overview of the product here... what it does and what it is:
for example: a Node based publicly accessible digital service for applying for waste permits.\>

## What's Where (An Index to the Contents of this Product)

Item | Location
------------ | -------------
Developer Guide | 
Application Architecture| 
Source|\<E.g. see the master branch of this repository for the latest released source\>

\<List the locations of all key items, especially any key documents here.

Essentially this is an index intended to allow anyone new to the project to find key items quickly.

Includes links to external items (which may or may not be directly accessible via GitHub, as some of those items could be sensitive).
For very sensitive items links may not be actual URLs, 
but descriptions of where an item is located that would be meaningful only to internal members of staff.
Items that should be included in this index:

* **The Application Architecture**

* **The Developer Guide**


If Software Engineering has mandatory support obligations associated with the product it is effectively a service, and a service will normally be of sufficient complexity and/or sensitivity that the Developer Guide and Application Architecture should be held in separate documents, possibly in secure locations. (GitHub readmes are much more appropriate as instructions for installing a product, such as a tool or library, for actual use, and/or for open source projects that are run as free collaborations. The readmes are far less appropriate for software engineers working on creating or running a service).  

But for a product that isn't a service, and provided the data isn't in any way sensitive, you may optionally include relevant sections of either (more likely) the Developer Guide and (possibly) Application Architecture here instead of maintaining that information in separate documents.

If doing so, for clarity, please provide a:

## Developer Guide

Heading for the developer guide section

and an:

## Application Architecture

Heading for any design detail you have also chosen to include.

Within those sections, again just for clarity, please try and use

### Sub-headings

that are the same as those in the current Developer Guide or Application Architecture templates.\>
